### Large-scale intent analysis for identifying large-review-effort code changes



Code changes can happen due to various reasons such as bug fixing, adding new features, code refactoring etc. In this paper, the authors present the study to leverage change intent to characterize and identify LargeReview-Effort (LRE) changes. Firstly, they proposed feedback-driven and heuristics-based  
approaches to identify the intent of code changes. Then they characterized them in terms of review efforts. Their results showed that code changes with some intent are more likely to be LRE changes. Microsoft has already started using the tool created in this study to give reviewers information on the  
review effort and intent information of changes to speed up the review process.
