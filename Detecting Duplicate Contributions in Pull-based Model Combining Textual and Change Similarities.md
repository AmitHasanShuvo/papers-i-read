# Detecting Duplicate Contributions in Pull-based Model Combining Textual and Change Similarities


In pull-based development, since the developers are not always physically present in the same place, contributors may make duplicate contributions to solve the same problem. If they aren't identified and dealt with right away, they could lead to more difficulties.  

In this paper, the authors proposed a combinational (textual and change similarities) approach to detect the duplicate contributions automatically at submission time. They made two intuitive hypothesis 1) if two pull requests are duplicate, they tend to have similar textual description and 2) if two pull requests are duplicate, they tend to have high overlap in changes.
