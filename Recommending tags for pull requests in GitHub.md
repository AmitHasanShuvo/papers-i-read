# Title: Recommending tags for pull requests in GitHub



Pull based development allows developers to contribute in a flexible and efficient way. In GitHub, contributors make code changes, then create and submit pull requests to projects. Tags is a great way to add additional information about pull request which can be beneficial for development purposes. 
In this paper, the authors proposed an approach to recommended tags for a pull request automatically. The authors measured the importance of tags from developers' perspective by doing survey. They pointed out some key functions of tags i.e describing functions, priorities, statuses and components.
They proposed a method FNNRec, a feed forward neural network to analyze the titles, descriptions, file paths and contributors. They also compared their approach with state of the art methods.
