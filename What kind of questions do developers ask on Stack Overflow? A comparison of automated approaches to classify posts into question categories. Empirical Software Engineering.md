# What kind of questions do developers ask on Stack Overflow? A comparison of automated approaches to classify posts into question categories. Empirical Software Engineering






Stack Overflow (SO) is considered as one of the most popular question and answer sites. In SO, developers use different tags to label different contents in order to facilitate question searching and browsing. In this paper, Stefanie Beyer el at. aim to automate the classification of SO posts into seven question categories. 

They manually labeled dataset that maps 2192 phrases of 1000 posts to 7 question categories.

In order to automate the classification task, the authors followed two approaches. They used regular expressions and machine learning techniques for the classification task. 

With the help of the question categories, researchers can improve SO-focused recommender systems.
