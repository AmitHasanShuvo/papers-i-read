# Whatâ€™s a Typical Commit? A Characterization of Open Source Software Repositories



In this paper, the authors investigated the version history of nine open source software projects in order to identify the characteristics of commits with respect to number of lines, number of files and number of hunks committed together.

They extracted the most common words from the commit messages and correlated them with the size categories of the commits. They examined three sizing-based characteristics of commits to understand the source code change.


They found some intriguing patterns among the features, such as bug-related changes being associated to relatively small-sized commits.
