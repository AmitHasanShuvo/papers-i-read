# Sampling Projects in GitHub for MSR Studies



Choosing the relevant software repositories is a necessary first step in almost every Mining Software Repositories (MSR) research. The majority of the time, these repositories are retrieved through hosting services like GitHub using particular selection criteria established by the study objective.

As an example, studies related to pull request categorization might be interested in selecting those projects that have a good number of pull requests. Researchers often face difficulties and limitations while sampling projects. To solve this issue, Ozren Dabic et al. presented the GHS Â (GitHub Search) dataset. GHS can be accessible from the web and allows to set different selection criteria.
