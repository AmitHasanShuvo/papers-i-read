# Pull request latency explained: an empirical overview

In pull-based development, pull requests can slow down due to various factors and inactive engagement between author and reviewer. In this paper, the authors, collected factors related to pull request latency through a literature review approach. Also, they evaluated their relative importance in five scenarios and six different contexts using a mixed-effect linear regression model. The authors also identified several effective insights. For example, after the closure of a pull request, process-related factors significantly gain more importance.
